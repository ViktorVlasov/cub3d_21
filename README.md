This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game, which was the first FPS ever. 

It's a “realistic” 3D graphical representation of the inside of a maze from a first person perspective. This made by using the Ray-casting principles.

It was made due to my studying in 21-school, Russia. The main goal of project - learn what is ray-casting is and make a program, which represents a walking into maze.
